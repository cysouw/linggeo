## Paper in development

The current draft is available as [html](paper.html) or [pdf](paper.pdf). Note that the html-version is a single file that is completely self-contained and can be easily saved for offline use, similar to the pdf-version (e.g. by right-clicking on the link and selecting "Save Linked File").

## Reimaginging WALS maps

Below are a few draft examples reimagining the display of the WALS data. The basemap is a voronoi-cartogram giving each language an approximately equal amount of area. Additionally, check out the different layers at the top left with (i) geographical interpolations of the data, showing areal tendencies, and (ii) possible areal "isoglosses", that can be nicely overlaid on the base map. All details are still in development, and I am happy to receive feedback.

These maps are completely self-contained single files and can be saved for offline use (e.g. by right-clicking on the link and selecting "Save Linked File").
