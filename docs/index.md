## Paper in development

The current draft is available as [html](paper.html) or [pdf](paper.pdf). Note that the html is a completely self-contained single file and can be easily saved for offline use (e.g. by right-clicking and selecting "Save Page As..." and choose Format: "Page Source").

## Reimaginging WALS maps

Below are a few draft examples reimagining the display of the WALS data. The basemap is a voronoi-cartogram giving each language an approximately equal amount of area. Additionally, check out the different layers at the top left with (i) geographical interpolations of the data, showing areal tendencies, and (ii) possible areal "isoglosses", that can be nicely overlaid on the base map. All details are still in development, and I am happy to receive feedback.

These maps are completely self-contained single files and can be saved offline (e.g. by right-clicking and selecting "Save Page As..." and choose Format: "Page Source").
